# Execution model

Runtime topology: **AWS serverless MVP** (**`docs/architecture.server.md`**).

## Infrastructure delivery

| Choice | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| **IaC** | **AWS CDK** (TypeScript) as the canonical way to declare stacks, synth to CloudFormation, deploy via **`cdk deploy`**. |
| **Lambda language** | **TypeScript** source → bundle/transpile → **Node.js** Lambda runtime (**`nodejs22.x`** or current LTS at ship time—pin in CDK **`Runtime`**). |

**Prefer serverless** managed services (**API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge/Scheduler, Cognito, CloudWatch**) for all default paths; add **VPC + ElastiCache** or similar only where the architecture docs already justify it.

## Compute

| Unit | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Lambda** | **Stateless** **TypeScript** request handlers; concurrency scales with API Gateway / EventBridge. Assume **cold starts**; avoid long init (cache TMDB config in global with TTL). |
| **API Gateway HTTP** | Routes to Lambda integration; optional **JWT authorizer** on admin routes. |
| **API Gateway WebSocket** | **`$connect` / `$disconnect`** + route selection to Lambdas; **`PostToConnection`** for broadcast. |

## Client

| Unit | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Browser SPA (or SSR)** | TypeScript SPA (React/Next per **`docs/architecture.frontend.md`**); YouTube iframe per tab; WebSocket loop for parties; **no** privileged secrets. |

## Background

| Unit | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Scheduled Lambda** | Reconcile + sweeper — TypeScript Lambdas — **bounded time** batch; continuation via next schedule or pagination cursors (**implementation**). |

## Decisions (answered)

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| IaC SAM vs CDK? | **CDK** as project standard. SAM/local still fine for **local** invoke/debug of individual handlers. |
| Lambda Python/Go? | **Not** default; **TypeScript** end-to-end for backend handlers unless a future component forces another runtime. |

## Primary code pointers (optional)

- CDK **`lib/`** stacks; **`src/handlers/**/*.ts`** (or repo convention TBD).
